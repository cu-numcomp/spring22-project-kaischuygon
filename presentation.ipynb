    "---\n",
    "* `LowRankApprox` is a julia package providing fast low-rank approximation algorithms for matrices. Information, installation and examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/LowRankApprox.jl).\n",
    "* low-rank approximation is a minimization problem, in which the cost function measures the fit between a given matrix (the data) and an approximating matrix (the optimization variable), subject to a constraint that the approximating matrix has reduced rank. The problem is used for mathematical modeling and data compression"

    "### Goal\n",
    "---\n",
    "* This program was developed with performance in mind.\n",
    "* The implementation borrows heavily from [Finding Structure with Randomness: Probabilistic Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Matrix Decompositions](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/090771806). \n",
    "* The implementation utilizes interpolative decomposition (ID) as the basic form of approximation instead of matrix range projection. The reason is that the latter requires expensive matrix-matrix multiplication to contract to the relevant subspace, while the former can sometimes be computed much faster, depending on the accelerated sketching strategy employed."

    "#### Metrics\n",
    "* This package has been developed with performance in mind, and early tests have shown large speedups over similar codes written in MATLAB and Python (and even some in Fortran and C). \n",
    "* For example, computing an ID of a Hilbert matrix of order 1024 to relative precision ~1e-15 takes:\n",
    "  * ~0.02 s using `LowRankApprox` in Julia\n",
    "  * ~0.07 s using SciPy in Python (calling a Fortran backend; see PyMatrixID)\n",
    "  * ~0.3 s in MATLAB\n",
    "* This difference can be attributed in part to both algorithmic improvements as well as to some low-level optimizations.\n",
    "* The computational complexity for each algorithm in included in the github README.\n",
